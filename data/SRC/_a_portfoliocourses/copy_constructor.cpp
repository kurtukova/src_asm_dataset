// A simple object with no dynamically allocated memory

public:
  
  // BasicNumber objects will store a single integer
  int n;
  
  // Our constructor will initialize the object's integer member variable
  BasicNumber(int set_n)

    n = set_n;
  }
  
  // The Copy Constructor is a special constructor that initializes the 
  // object using another object of the same type.  We set member variable 
  // n by *doubling* the other object's n member variable.  If we do not create 
  // our own custom copy constructor, C++ will automatically create a default 
  // copy constructor that will set the member variables of the one object to 
  // the value's of the other object's member variables (a member-wise 
  // assignment).  We call this a "shallow copy" of the object, and it may 
  // become a problem is our objects use dynamically allocated data (BasicNumber
  // does not use dynamically allocated data, this copy constructor is meant 
  // to illustrate the concept).
  BasicNumber(const BasicNumber& basic_number)
  {
    n = 2 * basic_number.n;
    
    cout << "Copy constructor called: " << n << endl;
  }
};

// The Number object has a member variable that points to dynamically
// allocate data, and we provide a copy constructor to perform a deep copy 
// instead of a shallow copy so that we don't run into problems!
class Number
{
public:

  // the member variable is a *pointer* to an int value, it will store the 
  // memory address of an int value
  int *n;
  
  // Our own constructor
  Number(int set_n)
  {
    // dynamically allocate space for an int on the heap, have n store the 
    // memory address of this int
    n = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));

    // dereference the pointer n to set the value at the memory address that 
    // n stores to set_n
    *n = set_n;
  }
  
  // The copy constructor makes a DEEP COPY of the object by using another 
  // Number object.
  Number(const Number& otherNumber)
  {
    // Similar to the constructor above, dynamically allocate space for an int.
    // This is key to making a "deep copy" of the object... we're going to 
    // give this object it's own space on the heap, that it's member variable 
    // n will then point to.
    n = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));

    // We assign to the int on the heap that n is pointing to, the value that 
    // the other object's pointer member variable n is pointing to, completing
    // the deep copy.  We've allocated space for the value, now we store into 
    // that space the same value that the other object has.
    *n = *(otherNumber.n);
  }
  
  // When a Number object is deleted, we'll free the dynamically allocated 
  // memory.
  ~Number()
  {
    free(n);
  }
  
  // returns the int value that n points to
  int get()
  {
    return *n;

int main()
{
  // Example 1 - Copy Constructor

  // Create BasicNumber object using our constructor (not the copy constructor)
  BasicNumber num1(7);
  
  // Output the int that num1 stores
  cout << "num1: " << num1.n << endl;
  
  // Creates object num2 by using the copy constructor we've created.
  BasicNumber num2 = num1;
  
  // When we output the int that num2 stores, we'll find it's double the int 
  // that num1 stores due to our copy constructor doubling the value before
  // assigning it!
  cout << "num2: " << num2.n << endl;
  
  // Create two more BasicNumber objects using our constructor (not the copy 
  // constructor).
  BasicNumber num3(5);
  BasicNumber num4(10);
  
  // This statement below should not be confused with object initialization, 
  // which is one of the places the copy constructor will run.  This statement 
  // below is the assignment operator, which is a different type of operation
  // that does not run our copy constructor.  The copy constructor we create 
  // may also run in some other instances, such as when a function returns an 
  // object as a value, or when a function receives the object as an argument 
  // when the parameter is passed by value.
  num3 = num4;
  
  
  // Example 2 - Copy Constructor To Perform Deep Copy 

  // Create a number object using the constructor (not the copy constructor)
  Number numA(8);

  // Output the value that numA's pointer member variable points to  
  cout << "numA: " << numA.get() << endl;
  
  // Create numB using the copy constructor
  Number numB = numA;
  
  // Output the value that numB's pointer member variable points to
  cout << "numB: " << numB.get() << endl;

  // If we modify the value that numA's pointer member variable points to, 
  // we'll find it has no effect on numB *because* we've implemented a 
  // deep copy
  *(numA.n) = 20;
 
  // Output the values that numA and numB's pointer member variables are 
  // pointing to, and we'll find they're different!
  cout << "numA: " << numA.get() << endl;
  cout << "numB: " << numB.get() << endl;

  // JUST FOR FUN...  :-)
  //
  // Try deleting the copy constructor we defined in the Number class! If you 
  // do, the default copy constructor C++ gives objects will be used instead 
  // in the above code.  The default copy constructor does a shallow copy of 
  // the object... assigning numA.n's pointer value (a memory address) to 
  // numB.n.  The problem is that both numA.n and numB.b will store the SAME 
  // memory address... i.e. they are referring to the SAME int value in 
  // memory.  This will have multiple consequences... in the above code when 
  // we change the value that numA.n is pointing to to 20, it will cause 
  // numB.n to point to 20 as well because numA.n and numB.n are storing the 
  // same memory address!  The program will also crash when the destructors 
  // for numA and numB BOTH run.  When numA's destructor runs it will free 
  // the dynamically allocated memory... but then when numB's destructor runs 
  // and it attempts to free the SAME memory that has already been freed it 
  // will cause our program to crash!
