* Program: Delete A Specific Line In A File
* 
* Description: Example of how to delete a specific line in a file using C++ (by
* line number).  We solve the problem by reading each line of the file and 
* storing it into a vector, and then writing these lines back to the file 
* EXCEPT for the line we wish to delete.
