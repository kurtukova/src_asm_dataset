/*
 * Ch02 Pr07 | C Programming, A Modern Approach
 *
 * Write a program that asks the user to enter a U.S. dollar amount
 * and then shows how to pay that amount using the smallest number
 * of $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills:
 * Enter a dollar amount: 93
 * $20 bills: 4
 * $10 bills: 1
 *  $5 bills: 0
 *  $1 bills: 3
 *
 *  Hint: Divide the amount by 20 to determine the number of $20 bills
 *  needed, and then reduce the amount by the total value of the $20
 *  bills. Repeat for the other bill sizes. Be sure to use integer
 *  values throughout, not floating-point numbers.
