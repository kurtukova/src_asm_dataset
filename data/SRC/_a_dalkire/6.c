/*
 * Ch02 Pr05 | C Programming, A Modern Approach
 *
 * Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for x and
 * then displays the value of the following polynomial:
 * 3x^5 + 2x^4 - 5x^3 - x^2 + 7x - 6
 * Hint: C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need to
 * multiply x by itself repeatedly in order to compute the powers of x.
 * (For example, x*x*x is x cubed.)
