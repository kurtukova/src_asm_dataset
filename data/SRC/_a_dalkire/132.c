 * Ch02 Pr02 | C Programming, A Modern Approach

 * Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a
 * 10-meter radius, using the formula v = 4/3Ï€r^3. Write the
 * fraction 4/3 as 4.0f/3.0f. (Try writing it as 4/3. What happens?)
 * Hint: C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need
 * to multiply r by itself twice to compute r^3.

/*
 * 4/3 as integer division rounds to 1 instead of 1.33, so the
 * volume is 3141.59 instead of the more accurate 4188.79.
