 * ----
 * Implementation notes:
 * So, somebody wants a block of memory... fine!  Here's the game
 * plan for getting them said memory:
 *
 * 1) Scan each block in our free list to see if any of them are
 *    big enough.  If we find one that is big enough, we will
 *    either use that memory as-is or chunk it into a couple smaller
 *    pieces (part of which is used, the other which is a new
 *    entry in the free linked list.
 * 2) If we do not find an item in the free list, we will add the
 *    new block onto the end of our heap.  We will attempt to expand
 *    the heap if needed.

/*
 * The free() function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which
 * must have been returned by a previous call to malloc(), calloc() or
 * realloc(). Otherwise, or if free(ptr) has already been called before,
 * undefined behavior occurs. If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.
 * ----
 * Implementation notes:
 * On free, we are given a pointer to an area of memory that is no longer
 * needed.  Immediately preceding this memory we should find a
 * memory_block_header_t with the length of the block.  Our full list of
 * steps are as follows:
 *
 * 1) Add forward reference from previous free block to this free block.
 * 2) Add backref from this free block to previous free block.
 * 3) Other small stuff (set next pointer to NULL, etc.)
 *
 * Basically, we are maintaining a linked list of freed blocks that we
 * may do with as we please.
 *
 * TODO: we currently don't set the break to ungrow the heap space for this
 * process.  This should be added in the future.
 *
 * TODO: we currently don't scan the entire linked list or manage blocks in
 * such a way that we can avoid fragmentation.  For instance, we leave a bunch
 * of gaps on the table when running simple_free_test().
