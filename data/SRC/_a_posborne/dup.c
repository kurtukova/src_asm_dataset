/*
 * dup.c
 *
 * Implement dup() and dup2() using fcntl() and, where necessary,
 * close().  (You may ignore the fact that dup2() and fcntl() return
 * different errno values for some error cases.)  For dup2(), remember to
 * handle the special case where oldfd equals newfd.  In this case, you
 * should check whether oldfd is valid, which can be done by, for
 * example, checking if fcntl(oldfd, F_GETFL) succeeds.  If oldfd is not
 * valid, then the function should return -1 with errrno set to EBADF.
 *
 * Here's a description of dup/dup2 from the man pages:
 *
 *     These system calls create a copy of the file descriptor oldfd.
 *
 *     dup() uses the lowest-numbered unused descriptor for the new descriptor.
 *
 *     dup2() makes newfd be the copy of oldfd, closing newfd first if
 *     necessary, but note the following:
 *
 *     *  If oldfd is not a valid file descriptor, then the call fails, and
 *        newfd is not closed.
 *
 *     *  If oldfd is a valid file descriptor, and newfd has the same value
 *        as oldfd, then dup2() does nothing, and returns newfd.
 *
 *     After a successful return from one of these system calls, the old and
 *     new file descriptors may be used interchangeably.  They refer to
 *     the same open file description (see open(2)) and thus share file offset
 *     and file status flags; for example, if the file offset is mod‚Äêified by
 *     using lseek(2) on one of the descriptors, the offset is also changed
 *     for the other.
 *
 *     The  two  descriptors  do not share file descriptor flags (the
 *     close-on-exec flag).  The close-on-exec flag (FD_CLOEXEC; see fcntl(2))
 *     for the duplicate descriptor is off.
