/* Programming Exercise 2-1 */

//Write a program that uses one printf() call to print your first name and last name on
//one line, uses a second printf() call to print your first and last names on two separate
//lines, and uses a pair of printf() calls to your first name and last names on one line.
//The output should look like this (but using your name):

//Gustav Mahler <- First print statement
//Gustav		<- Second print statement
//Mahler		<- Still the second print statement
//Gustav Mahler	<- Third and fourth print statements


#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Zhu Yifan\n");
	printf("Zhu\nYifan\n");
	printf("Zhu ");
	printf("Yifan\n");
	
	return 0;
}
