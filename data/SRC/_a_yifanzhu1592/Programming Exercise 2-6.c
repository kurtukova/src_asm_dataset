/* Programming Exercise */

// Write a program that creates an integer variable called toes. Have the program set toes
// to 10. Also have the program calculate what twice toes is and what toes squared is. The
// program should print all three values, identifying them.


#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int toes = 10;
	int toes_twice;
	int toes_squared;

	toes_twice = 2 * toes;
	toes_squared = toes * toes;
	
	printf("The value of toes is %d\n", toes);
	printf("The value of twice toes is %d\n", toes_twice);
	printf("The value of toes squared is %d\n", toes_squared);
	
	return 0;
