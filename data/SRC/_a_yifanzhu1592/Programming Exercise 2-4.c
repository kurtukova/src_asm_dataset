/* Programming Exercise 2-4 */

// Write a program that produces the following output:

// For he's a jolly good fellow!
// For he's a jolly good fellow!
// For he's a jolly good fellow!
// Which nobody can deny!

// Have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to main(): one named
// jolly() that prints the "jolly good" message once, and one named deny() that prints
// the final line once.


#include <stdio.h>

void jolly();
void deny();

int main(void)
{
	jolly();
	jolly();
	jolly();
	deny();
	
	return 0;
}

void jolly()
{
	printf("For he's a jolly good fellow!\n");
}

void deny()
{
	printf("Which nobody can deny!\n");
}
