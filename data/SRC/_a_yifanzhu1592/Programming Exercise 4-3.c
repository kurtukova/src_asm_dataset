/* Programming Exercise 4-3 */

// Write a program that reads in a floating-point number and prints it first in decimal-point
// notation and then in exponential notation. Have the output use the following formats
// (the number of digits shown in the exponent may be different for your system):

// a. The input is 21.3 or 2.1e+001.
// b. The input is +21.290 or 2.129E+001.


#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	float n;
	
	printf("Please enter a floating-point number:\n");
	scanf("%f", &n);
	printf("The input is %f or %e.\n", n, n);
	
	return 0;
}
