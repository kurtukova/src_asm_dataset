/*Write a program that produces the following output:
Brazil, Russia, India, China
India, China,
Brazil, Russia
Have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to main(): one named
br() that prints “Brazil, Russia” once, and one named ic() that prints “India, China”
once. Let main() take care of any additional printing tasks.*/
