/*In the U.S. system of volume measurements, a pint is 2 cups, a cup is 8 ounces, an
ounce is 2 tablespoons, and a tablespoon is 3 teaspoons. Write a program that requests a
volume in cups and that displays the equivalent volumes in pints, ounces, tablespoons,
and teaspoons. Why does a floating-point type make more sense for this application than
an integer type?*/
